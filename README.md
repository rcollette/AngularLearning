AngularLearning
===============
This project serves as a technology demonstration for using Angular, Bootstrap and Typescript.

The goal is to include examples of feature implementations that may be needed in applications beyond the scope of the typical Angular demos/tutorial code or that demonstrate the combined use of Angular, Bootstrap and Typescript.  This may include:

- Dependency based script loading using RequireJs
- Dynamic/Lazy loading of controllers
- Switching views in a parent scope from a sibling route scope.
- Off canvas menus
- Validation driven by service metadata originating from server side business objects.
- Unit/End to End testing
